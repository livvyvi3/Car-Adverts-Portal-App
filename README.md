## Overview
The project was to test of my fullstack skills and how I approach problems

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Have access to the Shop front, and request quotes on advert or more information.
- From admin end, the user must be able to open quote requests and create, update and delete adverts

## My process

### Built with

- SQL Express
- ASP.Net Web API

### What I learned

This challenge has helped me with refreshing my skills in C# and researching about a tool I am currently working on. It has also been an opportunity of looking into 
business logic and how I can make it better also using using web APIs. 

###Continued development
After this I would love to see myself with an continued efforts of learning about REST APIs. 
I feel I could have completed the project on time inspite of technical challenges with my pc, when it was crushing, I would have dynamically added Status and Condition 
dropdown lists if I had created a table for it thus improving the quality of the software. 

### Acknowledgments
Thank you Jethro and Aidan for the opportunity lookingforward to your feedback
